# Prabhjot-Week-8-Homework

## Reflection

Before beginning with this week, I had very less information regarding Ktor, all I knew that this is a framework which is used to make websites with Kotlin. But after this tutorial I learnt a lot about the Ktor which not only used to make web applications but also used to make microservices and more.
I found myself in wonder with some of the questions like how efficient the web applications (made with ktor) will be compared to the  web applications made using Javascript or React frameworks. For example the mobile applications made using Java are more efficient than the application made using React framework. I hope these questions will be resolved in the further tutorials.

As I progressed in the week further, I found that the Ktor docs really helped me as it was really easy to understand, without it I wonâ€™t be able to create a ktor project. Because whenever I use new frameworks, I face difficulties in the beginning part of the process like creating or setting up the IDE this time. To overcome this I had learnt that we have to always follow the documentation. For example this time I forgot to install the ktor plugin and was started finding that where to run a ktor project in it. Then after some time I begin to read the documentation and found myself completely dumb.

I have learned about how to create an static and interactive website using Ktor framework and freemarker. In my independent development assignment I shared some project ideas related to Unit Converter which included an android app. After learning about building a website using Ktor I would love create a website for it with a beautiful user interface. Moreover, we can create an HTTP API and can use that in both website and android app.
